# Tally Development Progress Changelog

## Calendar UI Redesign - September 2025

**Status:** Iterating (live in Overview view)

### Highlights
- Monday-first grid with 6×7 layout, showing adjacent-month spillover days.
- Subtle rounded tiles, selection ring, and hover states.
- Stacked provider logos: larger (+~20%), full-bleed circles, centered both vertically and horizontally, with gentle overlap and status dots (start/ending soon/end).
- Ongoing period represented by small service-colored pips (not bars); matching legend added.
- Header controls: chevrons + Today button and monthly spend summary.
- Hover price badge per day shows unique-provider total for that date.
- Sharper logos: TMDB image URLs upgraded to /original; full-bleed logos in day modal.
- Day detail modal refreshed with avatar circles and TOTAL row.
- Error handling: error boundary added around the calendar view to prevent blank screens.
- Clean-up: removed the descriptive blue info panel from Calendar page.

### Implementation Notes
- Data construction calculates displayType per provider per day (logo vs. in-between "pip" day) and sets flags for status dots.
- Legend clarifies pip semantics and status dots to avoid color ambiguity between providers.
- Capsule (row-spanning) mock was prototyped, reviewed, and then removed per direction.

### Files Touched
- apps/web/src/components/calendar/CalendarView.tsx — grid, tile visuals, stacked logos, pips, hover price badge, Monday start.
- apps/web/src/components/calendar/OverviewCalendar.tsx — data shaping, legend, monthly spend, header controls, modal styling, TMDB logo upgrade, selection state.
- apps/web/src/pages/Calendar.tsx — removed info panel; wrapped current view with ErrorBoundary.
- apps/web/src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx — new lightweight boundary component.
- docs/CalendarRedesignPlan.md — plan and progress tracking for redesign.

### Design Decisions
- Use minimal pips for continuity to reduce visual noise versus full bars.
- Provider color on pips; status conveyed via dots on the logo bubble (start/ending soon/end) for clarity.
- Keep light theme for now; dark mode will come as a separate pass.

### Next Steps
- Fine-tune logo size/overlap and pip size/placement if desired.
- Optional: responsive srcset for TMDB logos (w185/w500/original) to balance bandwidth and sharpness.
- Optional: compact provider-icon legend row.
- Optional: keyboard navigation for the grid and subtle month transition animation.

## Recent Updates - September 2025

### ✅ Episode Selection & Dynamic Button States Implementation (07_EPISODE_SELECTION_AND_DYNAMIC_BUTTONS.md)

**Major Features Completed:**

#### 1. **Episode Click Functionality from Search Results** 
- **Fixed API errors**: Resolved network failures when clicking episodes from search
- **Streamlined workflow**: Users can now click any episode in search results to:
  - Automatically add show to "watching" status
  - Mark clicked episode and all previous episodes as watched
  - Skip navigation to My Shows page entirely
- **Success feedback**: Clear notifications confirm successful episode progress setting

#### 2. **Visual Episode State System**
- **Green watched episodes**: Episodes marked as watched display with green background + ✓ tick mark
- **Blue next episode**: Current/next episode highlighted with blue styling
- **Grey future episodes**: Unaired episodes shown in grey with reduced opacity  
- **Consistent styling**: Same visual logic applied across Search and My Shows pages

#### 3. **Dynamic Button State Management**
- **Dual button state**: Shows "Add to Watchlist" + "Start Watching" buttons when show not in collection
- **Single watching button**: Displays full-width "✓ Watching" button when show is in watchlist
- **Removal functionality**: Click "Watching" button to remove show from watchlist and revert to dual buttons
- **Real-time updates**: Button states update immediately after user actions

#### 4. **Watchlist Status Detection**
- **Automatic checking**: Shows checked against user's watchlist when selected
- **Episode progress loading**: Watched episodes automatically loaded and displayed
- **Cross-page sync**: Changes in search results reflected in My Shows and vice versa
- **Performance optimized**: Efficient API calls with proper caching

#### 5. **Enhanced User Experience**
- **One-click episode selection**: Eliminated 3-4 navigation steps for common workflows
- **Visual feedback**: Immediate visual confirmation of episode states and actions
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- **Loading states**: Clear loading indicators during API operations

### Technical Improvements

#### API Integration
- **Fixed episode progress API**: Resolved issues with `/api/watchlist-v2/:tmdbId/progress` endpoint
- **Added removal endpoint**: Implemented show removal via DELETE `/api/watchlist-v2/:id`
- **Enhanced error handling**: Proper error responses and user feedback
- **Optimistic updates**: UI updates immediately with rollback on failures

#### Component Architecture  
- **Enhanced PatternAnalysis**: Added episode state visualization and click handling
- **SearchShows improvements**: Added watchlist status tracking and dynamic rendering
- **Shared state management**: Consistent episode state tracking across components
- **TypeScript enhancements**: Better type safety for episode and watchlist data

#### Visual Design System
```css
.episode-watched {
  @apply bg-green-50 border-green-200 text-green-800;
}

.episode-watched::after {
  content: '✓';
  @apply ml-2 text-green-600 font-bold;
}
```

### ✅ Previous Improvements (Earlier Sessions)

#### UI/UX Enhancements
- **Removed arrow emojis**: Cleaned up UI by removing unnecessary ▶️ and ► symbols  
- **Fixed redundant episode names**: Now hides "Episode X" when it's just a number, shows actual titles
- **Interactive episode timeline**: Episodes in search results now clickable with proper visual feedback
- **Improved progress display**: Better episode name handling in "Next: S2E3 - Episode Title" format

#### Bug Fixes
- **Calendar loading issues**: Fixed infinite loading states in calendar view
- **Dropdown overflow**: Fixed streaming service dropdowns extending outside containers  
- **Episode name fetching**: Enhanced episode title fetching from TMDB API
- **API endpoint corrections**: Fixed various API endpoint inconsistencies

#### Performance Optimizations
- **Reduced API calls**: Optimized episode data fetching to avoid redundant requests
- **Caching improvements**: Better caching of show and episode data
- **Loading states**: Added proper loading indicators throughout the application

### User Workflow Improvements

#### Before Updates:
```
Search Show → "Start Watching" → Navigate to My Shows → 
Find Show → Expand Show → Click Episode → Visual Feedback
(6-7 steps, multiple page navigations)
```

#### After Updates:
```
Search Show → Click Episode → Done!
(1 step, immediate feedback)
```

### Key Metrics
- **User workflow steps reduced**: From 6-7 steps to 1 step for episode selection
- **Navigation eliminated**: No need to leave search page for episode management
- **Visual feedback**: Immediate green checkmarks and episode state updates
- **Error rate reduction**: Proper API error handling and user feedback

### Documentation Created
1. **07_EPISODE_SELECTION_AND_DYNAMIC_BUTTONS.md**: Comprehensive implementation guide
2. **PROGRESS_CHANGELOG.md**: This progress tracking document

### Testing Completed
- ✅ Episode clicking from search results
- ✅ Visual episode state changes (green with ticks)
- ✅ Button state transitions (dual → single → dual)
- ✅ Watchlist removal functionality  
- ✅ Cross-page data synchronization
- ✅ Error handling and recovery
- ✅ Loading states and user feedback

### Future Enhancements Pipeline
1. **Season-level management**: Mark entire seasons as watched
2. **Bulk operations**: Multiple episode selection and marking
3. **Watch history**: Detailed viewing timestamps and history
4. **Notifications**: Episode release notifications and reminders
5. **Offline support**: Local storage for episode progress
6. **Analytics**: User viewing pattern analysis

### Architecture Notes
The implementation follows a modular, maintainable architecture with:
- Shared episode state logic across components
- Consistent API patterns and error handling  
- TypeScript type safety throughout
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Accessibility considerations for visual feedback

This update significantly improves the user experience by eliminating friction in the episode management workflow while maintaining consistency and reliability across the application.
