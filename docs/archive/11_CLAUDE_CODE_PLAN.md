# Tally Application Bug Fixes & Database Migration Plan

## Overview

This plan addresses 5 critical areas: pattern detection, poster loading, episode counters, TV guide functionality, calendar errors, and database integration.

## Phase 1: Search & Pattern Detection Fixes

### 1.1 Fix Premiere-Weekly Pattern Detection ✅

**Issue**: Shows with multiple premieres + weekly cadence (e.g., Alien Earth eps 1-2 on 12/08, then weekly) aren't detected as `premiere_weekly`
**Files**:

- `/packages/core/src/services/release-pattern.ts` - Added premiere_weekly pattern detection logic
- `/packages/types/src/index.ts` - Added premiere_weekly to ReleasePattern enum
- `/apps/web/src/components/PatternAnalysis.tsx:135-142` - Pattern colors/display

**Actions Completed**:

- ✅ Updated pattern detection algorithm to recognize multi-episode premieres followed by weekly schedules
- ✅ Added premiere_weekly pattern that detects same-day drops followed by weekly releases
- ✅ Added premiere_weekly to TypeScript types

### 1.2 Fix Older Season Pattern Detection ✅

**Issue**: Non-latest seasons should be marked as 'binge' since they're fully released
**Files**:

- `/apps/api/src/services/tmdb.ts` - Modified season analysis logic

**Actions Completed**:

- ✅ Modified season analysis to check if season is latest/current
- ✅ Auto-classify completed seasons older than 1 year as 'binge' pattern

## Phase 2: My Shows Page Fixes

### 2.1 Fix Missing Posters ✅

**Issue**: Posters not displaying from TMDB API response (`raw.poster_path`)
**Files**: `/apps/web/src/pages/MyShows.tsx` - Added fetchShowPoster function
**Actions Completed**:

- ✅ Implemented poster fetching from TMDB analyze endpoint and raw season endpoint
- ✅ Added poster caching with posterOverrides state
- ✅ Extract poster_path and construct full TMDB image URLs
- ✅ Added fallback handling for missing posters

### 2.2 Fix Episode Counter (2/x episodes) ✅

**Issue**: Episode counter shows `/undefined` instead of total season episodes
**Files**: `/apps/web/src/pages/MyShows.tsx:820-832` - Fixed episode counter logic
**Actions Completed**:

- ✅ Fixed episode count calculation to use actual season episode data
- ✅ Added fallback to total show episodes when season data unavailable
- ✅ Updated progress calculation logic with proper episode counting

## Phase 3: TV Guide Restoration

### 3.1 Fix Broken TV Guide ✅

**Issue**: TV Guide not populating with user shows from MyShows
**Files**: `/apps/web/src/components/tv-guide/TVGuide.tsx` - Fixed API URL
**Actions Completed**:

- ✅ Fixed API endpoint URL from `/api/tv-guide` to `http://localhost:4000/api/tv-guide`
- ✅ API endpoint was already properly implemented with user show integration
- ✅ TV Guide now fetches user's MyShows data correctly
- ✅ Infinite scroll and date navigation working

## Phase 4: Calendar Error Resolution

### 4.1 Fix Calendar TypeError ✅

**Issue**: `TypeError: endDate.toDateString is not a function` in OverviewCalendar.tsx:345
**Files**: `/apps/web/src/components/calendar/OverviewCalendar.tsx` - Fixed date handling
**Actions Completed**:

- ✅ Fixed date object handling in `getShowEndDate` function
- ✅ Added proper Date object validation and conversion for cached dates
- ✅ Updated cache loading logic to convert string dates to Date objects
- ✅ Added date validation with `isNaN(date.getTime())` checks

- `/apps/api/src/db/migrations/003_tv_guide_enhancements.sql` - TV Guide specific fields

**Actions Completed**:

- ✅ Complete database schemas for user shows, progress, preferences
- ✅ User-specific show lists with episode progress tables
- ✅ Country preference storage per user and per show
- ✅ Buffer days and streaming provider selection per show
- ✅ Comprehensive indexing for performance

### 5.3 Progress Tracking ✅

**Files**:

- `user_episode_progress` table - stores watch status per user/episode
- `user_season_ratings` table - season-level ratings
- `user_streaming_subscriptions` table - user's active subscriptions

**Actions Completed**:

- ✅ Episode watch status tracking per user
- ✅ Progress synchronization infrastructure ready
- ✅ Ratings system for shows, seasons, and episodes
- ✅ User subscription tracking for cost optimization
