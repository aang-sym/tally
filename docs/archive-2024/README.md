## Why Archived?

These documents were moved from `docs/archive/` to this organized structure during repository cleanup. They represent valuable historical context but are no longer actively referenced in current development.

**Current planning and documentation** lives in:

- `/CLAUDE.md` - Active development guidelines
- `/CLEANUP_PROGRESS.md` - Current cleanup roadmap
- `/docs/future-work/` - Upcoming issues/tasks
- `/README.md` - Project overview

## Retention Policy

These files are kept for:

- Historical reference
- Understanding past architectural decisions
- Tracking evolution of the project

If you need to reference a specific fix or decision, check here first before re-implementing.
