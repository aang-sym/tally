# iOS Plan (Tally)

## 0. Setup
- [x] Xcode project created inside `apps/ios`
- [x] Preview working with `ContentView`
- [ ] Add `.gitignore` entries for Xcode junk

## 1. Networking & API
- [x] Add `Info.plist` ATS exceptions for `localhost`
- [x] Create `Services/ApiClient.swift` with `health()` endpoint
- [x] Wire `ContentView` to call API and display status

## 2. Project Structure
- [ ] Create folders: `Views/`, `Models/`, `Services/`
- [ ] Keep `ContentView` simple → later becomes landing/home
- [ ] Use Swift packages if needed (e.g. Alamofire, Combine)

## 3. Environments
- [ ] Hardcode baseURL to `http://localhost:4000` for now
- [ ] Switch base URLs depending on build config

## 4. UI
- [ ] Add navigation container (`NavigationStack`)
- [ ] Scaffold simple screens: Subscriptions, Watchlist, Settings
- [ ] Connect UI → API client for real data

## 5. Testing
- [ ] Add unit test for `ApiClient.health()`
- [ ] Add snapshot test for `ContentView`

## 6. Next Steps
- [ ] Error handling & loading indicators
- [ ] Persist session/auth state
- [ ] Hook into shared monorepo API client models
