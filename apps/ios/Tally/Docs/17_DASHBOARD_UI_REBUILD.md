## Overview

This branch represents a ground-up rebuild of the dashboard experience to leverage iOS 26's new capabilities while creating a visually stunning, highly interactive interface centered around the user's streaming subscriptions.

## Major Features

### 1. Hero Section with Physics-Based Logo Animation

**The Centerpiece:** A full-screen hero section featuring bouncing streaming service logos with realistic collision physics, glowing effects, and CRT scanline overlay for a retro-futuristic aesthetic.

#### Technical Implementation

**Bouncing Logo Physics:**

- Real-time collision detection between logos using elliptical/rectangular bounds
- Display-synced animations via `CADisplayLink` for smooth 60/120fps rendering
- Predictive collision algorithm prevents overlap before it occurs
- Velocity-based bouncing with proper reflection physics
- Persistent logo positions across tab switches via singleton collision manager

**Visual Effects:**

- Multi-layer glow effects with service-specific colors (Netflix red, Disney cyan, etc.)
- CRT scanline overlay extending into notch for immersive effect
- Dark purple-to-black gradient background
- Logo glows overflow from containers for depth
- Dynamic logo scaling based on count (1-6 logos: 100%, 7+: scaled down to 60%)

**Key Components:**

- `HeroSection.swift` - Main container with gradient and scanlines
- `BouncingLogoView` - Individual logo with physics
- `ScatteredLogosView` - Layout and coordination
- `LogoCollisionManager` - Singleton state management
- `CollisionBoundsHelper` - Service-specific collision shapes

**Safe Area Handling:**

- Captures safe area insets before `.ignoresSafeArea()` is applied
- Offsets logo container to keep interactive elements below notch
- Gradient and scanlines extend into notch while logos stay below
- Clean coordinate system using container offset

#### Service Logo Assets

Added high-quality assets for 9 streaming services:

- Netflix, Disney+, Prime Video, HBO Max
- Apple TV+, Paramount+, Crunchyroll
- Stan, Binge

Each with custom glow colors, scaling factors, and collision shapes.

### 2. iOS 26 Native TabView Architecture

**Migration from Custom Navigation to Native:**
Rebuilt navigation using iOS 26's liquid glass TabView with native features:

#### Tab Structure

- **Home** - Full-screen hero with subscription overview
- **Calendar** - Week-based episode timeline
- **Discover** - Recommendations based on subscriptions
- **Search** - Native iOS 26 floating search button with morphing animation

#### Technical Details

- Liquid glass presentation (`.presentationBackground(.thinMaterial)`)
- Native search morphing with `.searchable()` modifier
- Tab-specific content without hero duplication (hero only on Home)
- Persistent hero state via collision manager singleton
- Fixed stuttering during tab switches using CADisplayLink

### 3. Enhanced Week Calendar View

**iOS 26 Design Overhaul:**
Comprehensive redesign of the episode calendar with modern materials and interactions.

#### Visual Improvements

- **Liquid Glass Integration:**
  - Week date strip with glass effect containers
  - Selected date cell with blue-tinted glass
  - Episode cards with `.ultraThinMaterial` backgrounds
  - Metadata badges with capsule glass effects

- **Typography & Spacing:**
  - System rounded design throughout
  - Increased font sizes (18pt dates, 20pt headers, 17pt titles)
  - Better vertical rhythm with 12-14pt padding
  - Consistent corner radii (16pt, 18pt)

- **Layout Refinements:**
  - Larger touch targets (44x44pt minimum)
  - Provider indicator dots with "+N" overflow
  - Today indicator with subtle border
  - Better episode card hierarchy

#### Interaction Improvements

- Modern `.smooth(duration:)` animations (0.35-0.4s)
- Symbol effects on expand/collapse with `.symbolEffect(.replace)`
- Scroll-to-date animation on cell tap
- Fixed day height calculations for consistent layout
- Proper animation timing between collapsed/expanded states

#### Components

- `WeekCalendarView` - Main calendar container
- `WeekDateCell` - Individual date cells with glass
- `EpisodeCardView` - Expandable episode cards
- `PosterView` - Poster image with shadows
- `MetadataBadge` - Glass-effect metadata pills

### 4. Subscription Management UI

**New Interfaces for Subscription Interaction:**

#### Provider Detail Sheet

- Native morphing animation to full search view
- Integrated with existing `SearchView`
- Searchable modifier with inline results

**Improvements:**

- Better contrast throughout

#### Spacing Constants

- Added `heroLogoSize: 78.65pt` (10% larger than original)
- Increased `cardCornerRadius: 16pt`
- Better component spacing scale

#### New Modifiers

- `.glassEffect()` for iOS 26 materials

- Enhanced card styling

## Technical Architecture

### State Management

- `DashboardViewModel` - Main dashboard state

## Key Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Animation Stuttering During Scroll

**Problem:** Hero logo animations paused when scrolling calendar or expanding cards.
**Solution:** Replaced `Timer` with `CADisplayLink` using `.common` run loop mode, ensuring animations continue during all UI interactions.

### Challenge 2: Logos Entering Notch Area

**Problem:** Safe area insets returned 0 after `.ignoresSafeArea()` was applied.
**Solution:** Captured safe area insets from parent GeometryReader BEFORE ignoring safe area, then passed value as parameter to HeroSection. Offset entire logo container instead of individual coordinates.

### Challenge 3: CRT Scanlines Behind Logos

**Problem:** Z-order issue with overlay rendering below logos.
**Solution:** Moved CRTOverlayView inside HeroSection's ZStack after ScatteredLogosView, ensuring proper rendering order.

### Challenge 4: Logo Collision Overlaps

**Problem:** Logos could overlap when colliding at specific angles.
**Solution:** Implemented predictive collision detection that checks PROPOSED position before moving, with fraction-based movement limiting.

### Challenge 5: TabView Layout Inconsistencies

**Problem:** Hero appeared on all tabs or caused layout issues.
**Solution:** Restructured to only include hero on Home tab, removed from Calendar/Discover tabs, maintained state via collision manager singleton.

## Breaking Changes

### Navigation Structure

- Old: Custom navigation with manual view switching
- New: Native iOS 26 TabView
- Migration: Update any direct navigation references

### Hero Section API

- Added required `safeAreaTop` parameter

### For Other Developers

**Pulling This Branch:**

1. Ensure Xcode 16+ with iOS 26 SDK
2. Clean build folder before building

- `WeekCalendarView.swift` - Calendar interactions

**Gotchas:**

- Safe area must be captured before `.ignoresSafeArea()`
- Glass effects require iOS 26 runtime
- CADisplayLink needs cleanup in `.onDisappear`
- Collision manager is singleton - state persists

## Build & Deploy

### Build Status

- ✅ Compiles with no errors
- ⚠️ 1 warning in SearchView.swift (pre-existing, tmdbId unused)
- ✅ No runtime crashes
- ✅ Memory profiling clean

### Deployment Notes

- Requires iOS 26 TestFlight/App Store
- Glass effects won't work on iOS 25 and below (add availability checks if needed)
- Test on multiple device sizes before release
