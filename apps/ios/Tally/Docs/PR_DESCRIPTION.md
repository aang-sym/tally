# Dashboard UI Complete Rebuild - iOS 26

## Summary

Complete redesign of the Tally iOS dashboard featuring a physics-based hero section with bouncing streaming logos, native iOS 26 liquid glass navigation, enhanced calendar interactions, and comprehensive visual polish.

## What's New

### ðŸŽ® Interactive Hero Section

- Full-screen hero with realistic bouncing logo physics
- Real-time collision detection between 9+ streaming service logos
- Multi-layer glowing effects with service-specific colors (Netflix red, Disney cyan, etc.)
- Retro CRT scanline overlay extending into notch
- Display-synced 60/120fps animations using CADisplayLink
- Logos persist positions across tab switches

### ðŸ“± iOS 26 Native Navigation

- Migrated from custom navigation to native TabView with liquid glass
- 4 tabs: Home, Calendar, Discover, Search
- Native floating search button with morphing animation
- Liquid glass presentation throughout (`.thinMaterial`)
- Hero section exclusive to Home tab for performance

### ðŸ“… Enhanced Week Calendar

- Liquid glass integration on date cells and episode cards
- Modern `.smooth()` animations with symbol effects
- Larger touch targets (44x44pt) and better spacing
- System rounded typography (18pt dates, 20pt headers)
- Provider indicator dots with overflow count
- Fixed day height calculations and animation timing

### ðŸ“Š Subscription Management

- New provider detail sheet showing subscription info
- Subscription list view with liquid glass overlay
- Enhanced subscription cards with glowing logos
- Dropdown actions for quick subscription management

### ðŸŽ¨ Visual Polish

- Added high-quality assets for 9 streaming services
- Service-specific glow colors and collision shapes
- Updated theme with hero background colors
- Better contrast and typography throughout
- CRT scanlines and purple gradient visual effects

## Technical Highlights

### Physics & Animation

- **CADisplayLink** for display-synced animations that continue during scroll
- **Predictive collision detection** prevents logo overlaps
- **Elliptical/rectangular collision bounds** per service logo
- **Singleton collision manager** for state persistence

### Safe Area Handling

- Captures safe area insets before `.ignoresSafeArea()` to pass as parameter
- Offsets logo container to keep interactive elements below notch
- Gradient and scanlines extend into notch while logos stay safe

### Performance

- 60fps standard, 120fps on ProMotion displays
- GPU-accelerated glass effects
- Efficient collision detection with early exits
- Proper resource cleanup (CADisplayLink on disappear)

## Files Changed

**Key Components:**

- `DashboardView.swift` - Main TabView container
- `HeroSection.swift` - Physics-based hero (+700 lines)
- `WeekCalendarView.swift` - Enhanced calendar (+500 lines)
- `ProviderDetailSheet.swift` - New subscription detail view
- `SubscriptionListView.swift` - New subscription list
- `RecommendationsPageView.swift` - New discovery interface

**89 files changed** | **+6,668** | **-401**

## Testing

âœ… Build succeeds with no errors
âœ… Hero logo physics tested on all device sizes
âœ… Tab switching performance verified
âœ… Search morphing animation working
âœ… Calendar interactions smooth
âœ… Glass effects work in light/dark mode
âœ… Safe area handling on notched devices
âœ… No memory leaks from CADisplayLink

## Requirements

- **iOS 26.0+** (uses `.glassEffect()`, native search morphing)
- **Swift 6** (`@Observable` macro)
- **Xcode 16+** with iOS 26 SDK

## Breaking Changes

- Navigation migrated from custom system to native TabView
- `HeroSection` now requires `safeAreaTop` parameter
- Search uses native `.searchable()` instead of custom search bar

## Documentation

Added comprehensive documentation:

- `17_DASHBOARD_UI_REBUILD.md` - Complete branch overview
- `16_HERO_SAFE_AREA_CONSTRAINT.md` - Safe area implementation
- `WEEK_CALENDAR_IOS26_IMPROVEMENTS.md` - Calendar redesign details

## Demo

(Add screenshots/video here)

**Hero Section:**

- Shows bouncing logos with glowing effects
- CRT scanlines and purple gradient in notch

**TabView Navigation:**

- Liquid glass tab bar
- Smooth transitions between tabs

**Calendar Interactions:**

- Glass effect on date selection
- Expandable episode cards
