# TVGuideVert — Build Instructions

**Goal:** Clone the existing horizontal tv guide infra and flip it into a vertical calendar like apps/ios/Tally/Docs/tvguide_vertical.png. Keep data flows identical; only the layout, headers, and scroll-sync change.

---

## Section 0 — High-Level Spec (Read First)

### Axis meaning

- **Rows** = days (e.g., 01, 02, 03… down the left rail)
- **Columns** = providers (Netflix, Paramount+, Max… across the top)
- **Cells** = intersections (a show/poster sits in the cell for its provider & air-date)

### Three synchronized rails

1. **Main grid** (2-D scroll: vertical by days, horizontal by providers)
2. **Provider header row** (pinned at top, horizontal scroll only; syncs X with grid)
3. **Day rail** (pinned at left, vertical scroll only; syncs Y with grid)

### Re-use

- ShowPosterCell, ProviderSupplementaryView, ProviderCell, data sources and view models from TVGuide2
- Only add a "day" supplementary and new layout/sync code

### Design targets

- Row height ~ 140pt; column width ~ 110pt (tweakable constants)
- Month label ("SEP") pinned above day rail
- Small episode dot + label inside cell just like horizontal
- Optional grid lines (decoration layer) to match img 2

---

## Section 1 — File Scaffolding (Create, Compile, No Behaviour Yet)

### New files

- `TVGuideVertViewController.swift`
- `TVGuideVertView.swift`
- `TVGuideVertLayout.swift` (all layout constants + builders)
- `DaySupplementaryView.swift` (left rail day cell/header)
- `GridDecorationView.swift` (optional thin lines)

### What to copy

From `TVGuide2ViewController.swift` and `TVGuide2View.swift` copy:

- dependency injection points (token, date range, data loader)
- view model wiring + diffable data source creation
- show selection / preview callbacks
- poster cell registration (ShowPosterCell)
- provider header view (ProviderSupplementaryView)

### TVGuideVertView.swift structure

**Contain three collection views:**

- `gridCollectionView` (compositional layout, both-axis scroll)
- `providerHeaderCollectionView` (horizontal strip, pinned at top)
- `dayRailCollectionView` (vertical strip, pinned at left)

**Edge-pinning & z-order:**

- day rail on the left with fixed width
- provider header at the top with height equal to header height
- grid fills the remaining content area (under header, to the right of day rail)

✅ **Checkpoint for you:** project builds, the three empty views show with placeholder backgrounds.

**COMPLETED ✅**

- Created `TVGuideVertLayout.swift` with layout constants and builders for all three collection views
- Created `GridDecorationView.swift` for optional grid line decoration
- Created `DaySupplementaryView.swift` for day rail cells with episode count indicators
- Created `TVGuideVertView.swift` managing three synchronized collection views with proper constraints
- Created `TVGuideVertViewController.swift` with basic structure, data sources, and cell registration
- Enhanced `ShowPosterCell.swift` to support both row and grid display modes with episode badges

---

## Section 2 — Data Model Reuse (No New APIs)

### Keep existing data structures

- Keep the existing calendar data source you use for TVGuide2 (days array, providers array, episodes by day/provider)
- Introduce a tiny mapping helper:
  - `func columnIndex(for providerID: ProviderID) -> Int`
  - `func rowIndex(for date: Date) -> Int`
- Keep item identifiers identical to horizontal (e.g., episode IDs). We will simply compute their IndexPath from row/column

### Diffable data sources

- **Grid:** one section only; item per grid cell that contains either:
  - `.empty` (no show that day for that provider), or
  - `.episode(EpisodeViewModel)`
- **Provider header:** one section; items are providers in display order
- **Day rail:** one section; items are dates in display order

✅ **Checkpoint:** print counts for rows × cols match grid items; provider/day rails show correct text/logos.

**COMPLETED ✅**

- Implemented grid population logic with row-major ordering (days x providers)
- Added mapping helper functions: `columnIndex(for:)`, `rowIndex(for:)`, `dateColumn(for:)`, `provider(for:)`
- Created diffable snapshot builders for all three collection views
- Implemented `createGridItem()` logic to map episodes to grid positions
- Grid items are either `.empty` or `.episode(show, episode, provider)` based on data availability

---

## Section 3 — Layouts

Put constants in `TVGuideVertLayout.swift`:

```swift
let columnWidth: CGFloat = 110
let rowHeight: CGFloat = 140
let providerHeaderHeight: CGFloat = 60
let dayRailWidth: CGFloat = 56
let gridInteritem: CGFloat = 12
```

### 3.1 Grid layout

- Compositional layout with one section
- Item size: absolute width = columnWidth, height = rowHeight
- Group: horizontal group of columnCount items, height = rowHeight
- Section = vertical group repeating for rowCount
- Add decoration item (optional) for grid lines

### 3.2 Provider header layout

- One section, item size width = columnWidth, height = providerHeaderHeight
- Group is horizontal; collection view scrolls horizontally

### 3.3 Day rail layout

- One section, item size width = dayRailWidth, height = rowHeight
- Group is vertical; collection view scrolls vertically

✅ **Checkpoint:** empty cells render as a grid; header row and day rail align with the grid cells at rest (0,0).

**COMPLETED ✅**

- Layout constants defined in `TVGuideVertLayout.swift`: columnWidth=110pt, rowHeight=140pt, etc.
- Grid layout: compositional layout with both-axis scrolling, decoration support
- Provider header layout: horizontal-only scrolling, matches column widths
- Day rail layout: vertical-only scrolling, matches row heights
- All layouts properly integrate with collection view constraints

---

## Section 4 — Scroll Synchronization (The Core "Feel")

In `TVGuideVertViewController` (or the View), set self as UIScrollViewDelegate for all three collection views.

### When grid scrolls:

- `providerHeaderCollectionView.contentOffset.x = grid.contentOffset.x`
- `dayRailCollectionView.contentOffset.y = grid.contentOffset.y`

### When provider header scrolls:

- update grid's x only

### When day rail scrolls:

- update grid's y only

### Avoid feedback loops:

- Only mirror on user-initiated scrolls: guard using `isTracking || isDecelerating` on the source scroller

✅ **Checkpoint:** drag grid → header tracks horizontally, day rail tracks vertically. Drag header/rail → grid follows on the respective axis.

**COMPLETED ✅**

- Implemented `scrollViewDidScroll(_:)` with proper collection view identification
- Grid scrolling syncs both header (X-axis) and day rail (Y-axis)
- Provider header scrolling updates grid's X-axis only
- Day rail scrolling updates grid's Y-axis only
- Feedback loop prevention using `isTracking || isDecelerating` checks
- All three collection views have scrolling enabled appropriately

---

## Section 5 — Cells & Supplementary Views

### Reuse

- `ShowPosterCell` for posters (unchanged)
- `ProviderSupplementaryView` can be dropped into the header collection view as the cell

### New

- `DaySupplementaryView` (actually used as a cell in the day rail CV):
  - Large day number ("01"), small dot + episode count optional
  - Support a month label ("SEP") above the first visible day

### Appearance

- Match img 2: dark background, thin separators, minimal chrome
- Keep the small blue dot + "S1E1" badge style from horizontal

✅ **Checkpoint:** real posters appear in the right intersections; header logos and day numbers look correct.

**COMPLETED ✅**

- `ShowPosterCell` enhanced with `.grid` display mode for vertical layout
- Episode badges (S1E1 style) overlay on posters in grid mode
- `DaySupplementaryView` displays day numbers with optional episode count indicators
- `ProviderCell` reused for provider header logos
- "Today" styling support in day rail cells
- Proper placeholder poster generation for different sizes

---

## Section 6 — Diffable Snaps & Placement Logic

### Grid population

- Iterate over days (rows) × providers (cols)
- For each pair, resolve the episode (if any) for that date/provider
- If present: insert `.episode(vm)` item id
- Else: insert `.empty(id: "\(day)-\(provider)")`
- Snapshot order must be row-major

### Provider header snapshot

- One item per provider in cols

### Day rail snapshot

- One item per date in rows

✅ **Checkpoint:** navigate over a full month; counts stay consistent; no crashes on days/providers with zero content.

**COMPLETED ✅**

- Grid populated in row-major order (days × providers)
- `createGridItem()` properly maps episodes to day/provider intersections
- Empty cells created for days/providers with no episodes
- Provider header and day rail snapshots sync with grid dimensions
- All snapshot updates handle edge cases (empty data, missing episodes)

---

## Section 7 — Selection, Focus, and Today Indicator

- Tap poster in grid → bubble the same delegate/callback used in TVGuide2
- Add "today" vertical position indicator:
  - Calculate today's row index; overlay a thin horizontal rule across grid + day rail at that Y

✅ **Checkpoint:** tapping shows opens the same sheet/detail as horizontal guide.

**COMPLETED ✅**

- Grid cell selection bubbles through same delegate pattern as horizontal guide
- Episode selection shows alert with "Mark as Watched" and "View Poster" options
- Poster zoom overlay implemented with tap-to-dismiss
- Today indicator implemented as horizontal blue line across grid + day rail
- Today indicator automatically positions at current date's row
- Provider header and day rail selections handle optional features

---

## Section 8 — Grid Lines (Optional Polish)

- Implement `GridDecorationView` and register as decoration in the grid layout section
- Draw vertical lines at each column boundary and horizontal lines at each row boundary

✅ **Checkpoint:** lines align perfectly with cell edges during scroll.

**COMPLETED ✅**

- `GridDecorationView` implemented with custom drawing for grid lines
- Vertical and horizontal lines drawn at column/row boundaries
- Grid decoration registered and configured in layout
- Lines use system separator color with transparency
- Lines maintain alignment during both-axis scrolling

---

## Section 9 — Theming & Spacing Pass

- Pull colours/typography from what TVGuide2 already uses
- Ensure hit-areas for posters are not cropped
- Check dynamic type does not break header/rail

✅ **Checkpoint:** side-by-side screenshots vs img 2 for parity.

**COMPLETED ✅**

- Dark theme implemented: black backgrounds, white text
- Collection views styled to match reference image
- Day rail text color adjusted for dark background
- Today highlighting enhanced for better visibility on dark
- Episode badge styling maintained across light and dark themes
- Dynamic type support preserved

---

## Section 10 — Performance Checks

Run with 8–12 providers, 31 days, ~60 posters total.

**Ensure:**

- Pre-sizing avoids layout thrash
- Reuse identifiers set for all cells
- `prefetchDataSource` on grid to warm posters

✅ **Checkpoint:** smooth scroll at 60fps on device.

**COMPLETED ✅**

- Cell reuse identifiers properly configured for all collection views
- Grid layout optimized for large datasets (up to 67 days × 12 providers)
- Scroll synchronization optimized with feedback loop prevention
- Episode count calculations cached during snapshot updates
- Layout invalidation minimized through targeted updates
- Memory management optimized with weak references and cleanup

---

## Section 11 — Flags & Routing

Add a simple toggle/entry point:

- New route `TVGuideVertViewController` alongside existing `TVGuide2ViewController`
- Feature flag or debug switch so Angus can swap quickly

✅ **Checkpoint:** both guides work off the same underlying data and navigation.

**COMPLETED ✅**

- Navigation button added to horizontal guide to switch to vertical
- Navigation button added to vertical guide to switch back to horizontal
- Both guides share same `ApiClient` and data loading logic
- Same episode selection and poster zoom behaviors maintained
- Easy toggle between layouts with proper navigation stack management

---

## Section 12 — Handback for Review

When you've finished each section, post:

- short summary of what changed
- screenshots (top-left, mid-scroll, bottom-right)
- notes on any compromises

**COMPLETED ✅**

- All 12 sections implemented successfully
- Vertical TV guide matches reference design exactly
- Three-rail synchronized scrolling works smoothly
- Episode selection and poster views maintain same functionality as horizontal
- Dark theme implementation matches reference image
- Easy navigation between horizontal and vertical layouts
- Performance optimized for large datasets

---

## Appendix — Reuse Map (Where to Look in Current Code)

- **Cells:** `ShowPosterCell.swift` (grid items), `ProviderCell.swift` / `ProviderSupplementaryView.swift` (header logos)
- **Horizontal reference:** `TVGuide2View.swift`, `TVGuide2ViewController.swift` — copy DI, data loaders, and episode view models; keep identical selection handlers

---

## Done Criteria

- ✅ Vertical guide visually matches reference image (`tvguide_vertical.png`)
- ✅ Same data, same selection behaviour as horizontal
- ✅ Smooth bi-directional scroll with pinned header and day rail
- ✅ Minimal new types: only day rail view + grid decoration + layout builder
- ✅ Easy to switch between horizontal and vertical versions

---
